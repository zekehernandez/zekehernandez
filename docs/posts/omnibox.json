{"title":"How's your Omnibox game?","slug":"omnibox","html":"<p>By now, many of you know that you can set up custom search engines to use in\nChrome&#39;s Omnibox, they&#39;re super handy. If you know how to set one up, skip down \na paragraph; if not, here&#39;s how: In Chrome, go to <em>Settings &gt; Manage search engines</em>. \nHere you can define custom search engines that have three properties: a name, \nan alias, and a URL. For example, I have a custom search engine called Wikipedia, \nwith an alias <em>wiki</em>, and <em><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Search&amp;search=%s\">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Search&amp;search=%s</a></em> \nas the url. The <em>%s</em> will be replaced by the search string. If I want to search \nWikipedia, all I have to do is, in the Omnibox, type <em>wiki</em> (space or tab) and \nthen the search string (whatever I want to search for), and bam, it is searched.</p>\n<p>Now, being able to search websites easily through the Omnibox is well and good, \nbut let&#39;s try thinking outside of the (Omni)box. I will share with you some of \nmy favorite custom search engines, and why they are great (or at least neat).</p>\n<p>In order from neat to necessary:</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-translate-for-me-english-to-spanish\">5. Translate (for me, English to Spanish)</h3>\n<h5 id=\"url-httpstranslategooglecomsourceosddeness\">URL: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://translate.google.com/?source=osdd#en/es/%s\">https://translate.google.com/?source=osdd#en/es/%s</a></h5>\n<p>Where <em>en</em> is the &quot;from&quot; language, and <em>es</em> is the &quot;to&quot; language.\nI would rank this higher if I used it more, but still, handy in a pinch! I&#39;m sure \nyou could do the same with another translating service.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-thesaurusdictionary\">4. Thesaurus/Dictionary</h3>\n<h5 id=\"thesaurus-url-httpwwwthesauruscombrowsesst\">Thesaurus URL: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.thesaurus.com/browse/%s?s=t\">http://www.thesaurus.com/browse/%s?s=t</a></h5>\n<h5 id=\"dictionary-url-httpswwwmerriam-webstercomdictionarys\">Dictionary URL: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/%s\">https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/%s</a></h5>\n<p>Obviously, use whatever dictionary website you want. Once I set up the thesaurus\nsearch engine, I find that I use it a surprising amount! And now I write illustriously.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-work-related-things\">3. Work related things</h3>\n<p>I use a lot Atlassian products, like Jira and Confluence, and I&#39;ve set up a custom\nsearch engine for Confluence, and one search engine for each Jira board I&#39;m \ninterested in. If you or your company has some sort of intranet site or wiki or\nonline documentation, a custom search engine works like a charm.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-maps\">2. Maps</h3>\n<h5 id=\"url-httpswwwgooglecommapssearchs\">URL: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/search/%s\">https://www.google.com/maps/search/%s</a></h5>\n<p>I use <em>maps</em> as the alias, so I can type &quot;maps Chipotle&quot; and will immediately be\nshown the nearest Chipotles, which is cool, but we can take it a step further.\nI can also type &quot;maps here to Chipotle&quot; and I will be given directions to the \nnearest Chipotle. Technology at it&#39;s finest. Furthermore, if you have your home\nor work location set with Google Maps, you can type things like\n&quot;maps work to Chipotle&quot; and be given directions for that.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-gifs\">1. Gifs</h3>\n<h5 id=\"google-url-httpswwwgooglecomsearchqstbmischtbsitpanimated\">Google URL: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=%s&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbs=itp:animated\">https://www.google.com/search?q=%s&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbs=itp:animated</a></h5>\n<h5 id=\"giphy-url-httpsgiphycomsearchs\">Giphy URL: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://giphy.com/search/%s\">https://giphy.com/search/%s</a></h5>\n<p>You want to be the fastest gif in the West? This is how. Call me old-fashioned,\nbut I prefer Google&#39;s animated image search over Giphy, especially at work. I\nmean, the last thing I want is a bunch of flashing colors and images on my screen\nto draw attention to the fact that I&#39;m looking for a gif.</p>\n<h4 id=\"honorable-mentions\">Honorable Mentions</h4>\n<p>Amazon, YouTube, Google Calendar, Bible Gateway, Spotify</p>\n<p>Happy searching in a customized way!</p>\n","date":"2018-01-09T01:35:26.000Z","excerpt":"\nIf you are developer chances are, if you are on your computer, you\nhave a web browser open.
