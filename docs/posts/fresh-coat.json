But a couple weeks ago I switched from a light theme to a dark theme,\nhand selected a few colors for major text editor elements (like keywords, comments\n, and literals), and switched the font to Inconsolata.</p>\n<p>All these changes are very superficial, but they helped usher in a new energy when\ncoding. Furthermore, it encouraged me to treat my code as an art: visually pleasing,\neasy to read and understand, and structurally consistent.</p>\n<p>If you feel like your maybe in a rut with coding, try shaking things up a little.\nSmall changes can help add some excitement from what can easily become a daily grind.</p>\n","date":"2017-12-11T23:18:32.000Z","excerpt":"\r\nMy wife and I recently painted several rooms in our house. The old colors were \r\nfrom the previous owners and we wanted to make the house more our own. It really\r\nis surprising how much a new wall color can change the overall vibe of a room.\r\nIt's quite refreshing and brings a new life to the space.\r\n\r\n","printDate":"December 11, 2017","printReadingTime":"1 min read"}
